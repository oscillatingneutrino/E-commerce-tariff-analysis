## Executive Summary

The effects of tariffs have had several effects TEMU's profits: gross margin remains unaffected, and saw an increment during the peak of tariffs, although revenue decreased. Customers were observed to spend less and access the site less. Logistics have largely remained unaffected, but the price of parcels was made to be comparable to that of non-foreign companies. As a result of insufficient data, predictive modeling would only be inaccurate. Despite this, metrics negatively affected by tariffs saw a rise when tariffs were relaxed.


## Project Background
TEMU, the 2nd ranked E-Commerce site has seen recent growth amongst the general public as a result of its convenience and affordability. Being a Chinese site, it is affected by new tariffs. This project analyzes the effects of tariffs on profitability. In doing so, this project hopes to both understand the effect of tariffs on international electronic commercialism and the possible effects it has had on consumer spending habits.

## Tariffs Affecting E-Commerce From China
Data from TEMU's profits up to the 2nd quarter of 2025 have been made available, and thus data from 2023 Q1 to 2025 Q2 is used. As such, the effect of tariffs only up to June 30th is used. Following is a simple timeline of tariffs passed relevant to e-commerce from China following the election of Donald Trump.

Feb 1, 2025
	Trump Imposes a 10% on Chinese Goods; De minimis exemption ended, making parcels face customs declarations and duties

April 2, 2025
	Trump increments total Chinese import tariffs to 54% and re-imposes the ban on de minimis exemptions

May 12, 2025
	Trump reduces tariffs to 10%, China reduces their tariffs on the US to 30%, and the US creates a 90 day pause on new trade barriers. The de minimis rule is amended for low 	value shipments

May 30, 2025
	Trump states that China has not eased their rare-earth export restrictions, stating that the previous truce was broken

June 11, 2025
	Trump proposes 55% tariffs on Chinese goods (10% universal on extras). China agrees to supply rare earths and ease export licensing. US relaxes restrictions on Chinese students and some exchanges

June 27, 2025
	China has the option to approve export applications for controlled items. The US would also lift several restrictive measures.

## Growth Metrics

![Growth](png/Growth.png)

In order to determine the growth of TEMU, the Quarter on Quarter Growth (QOQ) and the Revenue are plotted, with their performance observed from Quarter 1, 2023 to Quarter 2, 2025. There is continuous growth observed in the overall revenue, except for the decrease in revenue during the first quarter of 2025. This drop occurred during the beginning wave of tariffs, which created a noticeable effect on consumer interest in electronic commerce. As talks continued between the United States and China, and reductions in the effects of tariffs on parcels decreased,revenue rebounded and started to show growth during Q2, 2025. 

In contrast, the QOQ initially also gives the notion that tariffs are responsible for a decrease in quarter on quarter growth, but an important pattern emerges: growth decreases during the transition between the last year's fourth quarter, and the next year's first quarter, before rebounding during the second quarter, decreasing during the 3rd quarter, and then returning to a high peak in the fourth quarter. This trend seems to instead imply that QOQ behavior is substantially influenced by consumer spending habits, rather than external factors. One should note that the fourth quarter encapsulates the holidays, the time during which clients are more inclined to spend on gifts. The quarter after would then reflect the time during which consumers are less incentivised to spend, a behavior that begins to end by the time the second quarter rolls around. That being said, there is a visible decrease in the absolute QOQ value during the beginning of tariffs relative to other years, which indicates the overall decrease in the amount that individuals are willing to spend on products from TEMU, which is likely a result of tariffs.

In the above graph, revenue is presented next to the online marketing services and others. Both follow the same trends; they have similar peaks and troughs throughout each quarter. Despite the large difference between both lines numerically, this graphic suggests that both revenue and online marketing services and others are influenced by consumer values and tariffs, especially as shown during the dip during Q1 of 2025. Despite this, both lines show continuous growth, representing the continued popularity and influence of TEMU.


## Profitability Ratios

![Margin](png/margin.png)

In the graphic above, the operating margin and the gross margin are compared throughout the set of quarter ranges. Looking at the operating margin one can note the comparatively smaller numbers per quarter. Generally speaking, the margin continues rising until after the 2nd quarter of 2024, at which point it continues to decrease, reaching a low during Q1 of 2025, and returning to margins comparable to previous quarters during Q2 of 2025. That being said, however, after the major drop from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024, the margin stays more or less within the same range of all values; the only other major reduction in margin occured during the first quarter of 2025, when the tariff war between the United States and China had begun. Once more, during the second quarter, when tariffs began to relax, the operating margin returned to a more common value.

Interestingly enough, the gross margin experienced no major effect from tariffs, and as a matter of fact, had a slight increase (0.41%) during the period of time when tariffs were meant to be in full force. All major decreases in the gross margin (Q1 2023 to Q2 2023, Q2 2024 to Q3 2024) occurred prior to the introduction of tariffs. Beyond that, the gross margin remains within the same range of numbers throughout the course of the studied quarters. This means that despite tariffs, TEMU has largely remained efficient in the way it manages its expenses and in generating a net profit. Furthermore, the relatively constant metrics imply that tariffs have not affected the operation of TEMU, and decreases in profitability are more likely to be affected by other sources, such as competition from other e-commerce sites and the opinions of online shoppers.


![Marketing Efficiency Ratio](png/marketingefficiencyratio.png)

Generally speaking, a marketing efficiency ratio (MER) above 3.00 is considered a valuable goal to attain, as it serves as a benchmark for an efficient marketing strategy. This number, however, is usually higher for e-commerce (around 5.0). In the above chart, the MER continues to be below the 5.0 threshold; the highest value it attains is below 4.0. TEMU's situation, however, is slightly different than other e-commerce sites; beyond competition from other e-commerce sites, TEMU, as a mature brand, continues to spend a lot of revenue on ads in order to reach a wider audience (e.g. ads during the 2024 Super Bowl, which are estimated to have cost $21 million dollars). As such, it is expected that TEMU should have a low MER value. That being said, a low point was hit during Q1 of 2025. During this time, TEMU is estimated to have spent about $59 M on marketing in sites such as Snapchat and Facebook<sup>1</sup>. This large amount of money being spent on ads is indicative of needing to spend more money to attract individuals who were turned away by the prospect of having to spend just as much money on a product from TEMU as they would from a non-foreign company.

## Liquidity Metrics

![Liquid](png/liquid.png)

In order to better appreciate the trends in cash flow metrics, receivables from online payment forms were scaled by a factor of 10. Likewise, short term investments were scaled down by a factor of 10. In doing so, one can note an increment in both the receivables, in the cash and cash equivalents, and the short term investments during Q1 2025. Unlike most of the other metrics previously discussed, the aforementioned metrics displayed an increment during the period meant to represent the time of the harshest tariffs. This trend implies that TEMU's assets remained intact throughout the course of tariffs, they continued to profit throughout the first Quarter of 2025, and that the company prefers liquidity, opting instead to have a cushion in the case of economic downturn (as was expected earlier in the year prior with Trump's announcement of tariffs if he were to be elected). 

## Cash Flow Metric

![netcash](png/netcash.png)

The amount of cash generated from both inventory and online sales follows a predictable pattern: there is a peak in performance during Q4 of the previous year, and a trough during Q1. Although this seems to be the trend, the net amount of cash flow saw one of the worst performances during the quarter where tariffs were being introduced, implying a decrease in the amount customers willing to spend. That being said, overall, the amount of cash being generated in this manner follows a net positive trend, with a visible rise during Q2 2025, during the relaxation of tariffs.

## Trend in Public Interest
Currently, TEMU - for reasons related to security - does not publicly publish data relating to customer retention or any sort of marketing related metrics. As such, interpolation on the use of TEMU is based on data provided from Google Trends from the beginning of Q1, 2023 to Q2, 2025. 

The following graphic shows a noticeably downwards trend in the popularity of TEMU. The red marking represents dates at which new tariffs were imposed. A clear peak of popularity occurs after July 2023, and a subsequent semi-consistent period of an average amount of searches until a spike around the beginning of 2025 and a continuous downwards trend soon after.

![BigGraph](png/BigGraph.png)

A more refined analysis of the search behavior shows a continuous downward trend that is consequent of the announcement of tariffs beginning on February 2nd, 2025. The most notable effect of tariffs was that parcels (one of the more attractive selling points) would no longer be sold at reduced prices, and thus have to sell at prices similar to those of American companies. Along with that, growing distrust in TEMU arrived as a result of questions concerning data privacy and the potential of getting low-quality products. These two factors are likely to have resulted in individuals losing trust in the company and having no financial incentive to outweigh their distrust in the foreign company. As such, the amount of traffic received by TEMU has significantly decreased since the beginning of 2025:

## Recommendations

Being a foreign site, TEMU must not only face tariffs, but also a growing sense of distrust amongst individuals worried about the security of their data and personal information. Their ability to give foreign clients trust in their system is largely diminished by the amount of people who will relate their negative experiences on social media and by skepticism from other individuals; stories that are likely to gain more and more traction amongst social media. This issue has always existed, but customers chose to ignore the risks to their personal information as a sort of compromise to the low prices of attractive items sponsored through social media sites like TikTok. Since tariffs have reduced this aspect/incentive, TEMU must instead choose to continue to reach out to content creators and influencers, and buy advertisement spots across all forms of media in order to retain brand visibility; once tariffs begin to relax, TEMU can expect customers to go back to buying off of their site.

The issues with outreach are not limited to a foreign audience, however; TEMU must also compete with other sites, such as JD.com, Alibaba, and Douyin, the latter of which has the advantage of integrating itself with local forms of social media. Thus, it is recommended to invest in appealing to their non-foreign audience and seek to popularize themselves further through their country of origin. Successful amongst the Chinese audiences is live-streams, which provide viewers with the possibility of engaging with an individual using the site to purchase goods. It would then follow that a viewer would be more inclined to use TEMU upon seeing a trusted figure using the site.

Further comments on TEMU's practices cannot be made; their current model of connecting consumers directly to manufacturers is in large part the reason for their high degree of success; changing this model by offshoring manufacturing to other countries with lower tariff rates is non-sensical and would add unneeded layers to communication and costs, when production of items on TEMU is already low enough. The only recommendation one can make outside of marketing is to maintain a portion of its assets as liquid in the case of further changes in international economic policy, as doing so allows a company to maintain the funds required to keep functioning.

## Clarifications
PDD Holding's (the parent company of TEMU) does not actively separate the finances for TEMU from their other ventures. Therefore, the data being used for this analysis only works as an intermediate for the actual revenue of TEMU; the results should only be taken as approximations. The currency used in this project is the Chinese Yuan; all of the reported numbers were given as unaudited.
